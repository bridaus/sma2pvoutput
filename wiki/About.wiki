= About SMA2PVOutput.ps1 =

SMA2PVOutput.ps1 is a [#Windows_PowerShell Windows Powershell] script that takes data from one or more [#SMA_Inverter SMA inverters] and uploads it to [#pvoutput.org pvoutput.org]

<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />

= Introduction =

The SMA2PVOutput.ps1 script is intended to be used in conjunction with the [#Sunny_Explorer Sunny Explorer] software from SMA to gather data from a solar PV plant and upload it to [#pvoutput.org pvoutput.org].

The script can be run on a scheduled basis to periodically post status updates that can then be viewed remotely via the [#pvoutput.org pvoutput.org] web site.

== Donations ==

Please consider donating to PVOutput via their [http://www.pvoutput.org/donate.jsp donations page]. Bitcoin donations to the SMA2PVOutput.ps1 [#About_the_Author author] are also welcome via the address `182naT22dToTg7jQ9KM2KmKFnjfqeRna2F`.

= Getting Started =

== PVOutput.org ==

http://www.pvoutput.org is a free service for sharing, comparing and monitoring live solar photovoltaic (PV) and energy consumption data. In order to upload data to a system on PVOutput, it is first necessary to register an account.

Once you have registered a user, log in and [#Adding_a_System add your system(s)] to the account.

For more information on PVOutput, see http://www.pvoutput.org/help.html

=== API Settings ===

Your [http://www.pvoutput.org/account.jsp account settings] page on pvoutput.org includes a section titled API Settings. In order for the script to function you should ensure that the `API Access` setting within this section is set to `Enabled`.

Once `API Access` is `Enabled`, you need an [#$ApiKey API Key] which can be generated from the [http://www.pvoutput.org/account.jsp account settings] page by clicking on the `New Key` button. The [#$ApiKey API Key] is stored in the SMA2PVOutput.ps1 script as a method of authenticating with [#pvoutput.org pvoutput.org].

=== Adding a system ===

Your [http://www.pvoutput.org/account.jsp account settings] page on pvoutput.org also includes a section titled Registered Systems. Use the `Add System` link to register a new system. The [#$SystemId System Id] is also stored in the SMA2PVOutput.ps1 script as a means of identifying the system whose data is being uploaded.

== Hardware Requirements ===

=== SMA Inverter ===

The SMA2PVOutput.ps1 script uses the SMA [#Sunny_Explorer Sunny Explorer] tool to obtain data from the PV inverter. It should therefore work with any SMA inverter supported by Sunny Explorer.

A PV plant can comprise one or more inverters. The SMA2PVOutput.ps1 script is designed to work with PV plants containing up to 4 inverters.

=== Network Connectivity ===

The Windows system on which the script runs should have network connectivity to the PV Plant (typically via Bluetooth). To test this, verify that [#Sunny_Explorer Sunny Explorer] is able to connect to the plant.

The Windows system should also have access to the internet in order to post status updates to PVOutput. Ensure that any software or hardware firewalls allow access by the user running the script to the [#pvoutput.org pvoutput.org] web site.

== Software Requirements ===

=== Windows !PowerShell ===

The script has been tested with Windows !PowerShell 4.0, but is intended to work with Windows !PowerShell 3.0 or above. !PowerShell 3.0 is part of the Windows Management Framework 3.0 (WMF3) and requires Windows 7 Service Pack 1 or higher with .NET Framework 4.0. !PowerShell 4.0 is a component of WMF4 and requires .NET Framework 4.5.

=== Sunny Explorer ===

Sunny Explorer is a software tool provided by SMA Solar Technology AG for visualising and managing data from one or more SMA inverters. The SMA2PVOutput.ps1 script uses functionality provided by the Sunny Explorer application to export status information from the inverter(s) to a comma separated value (CSV) file.

The latest version of Sunny Explorer can be downloaded from https://www.sma.de/en/service/downloads.html. The SMA2PVOutput.ps1 script has been tested with Sunny Explorer v1.07.9.

== Getting Started ==

=== Configuring Sunny Explorer ===

Once you have installed Sunny Explorer, you will need to launch the application and follow the Plant Assistant which guides you through establishing a connection to your PV plant. Details of the plant are stored in a .SX2 file (or possibly a .SXP file in older versions) whose name matches the one you gave to the plant in Sunny Explorer.

The [#$PlantName plant name] and [#$PlantExtension extension] are stored in the SMA2PVOutput.ps1 script and are used when invoking Sunny Explorer to determine the plant whose data is to be uploaded to PVOutput.

The SMA2PVOutput.ps1 script should cope with most date, time and number formats but it is recommended that the settings used within Sunny Explorer match those used by Windows.

Additionally, it is recommended to set the Time Format within Sunny Explorer to 24-hour. To do this, launch Sunny Explorer and highlight the Sunny Explorer branch in the navigation pane. Within the Device settings on the right, ensure the Time Format is set to `HH:mm` and _not_ `hh:mm`.
