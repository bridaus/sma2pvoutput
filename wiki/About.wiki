= About SMA2PVOutput.ps1 =

SMA2PVOutput.ps1 is a [#Windows_PowerShell Windows Powershell] script that takes data from one or more [#SMA_Inverter SMA inverters] and uploads it to [#pvoutput.org pvoutput.org]

<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />

= Introduction =

The SMA2PVOutput.ps1 script is intended to be used in conjunction with the [#Sunny_Explorer Sunny Explorer] software from SMA to gather data from a solar PV plant and upload it to [#pvoutput.org pvoutput.org].

The script can be run on a scheduled basis to periodically post status updates that can then be viewed remotely via the [#pvoutput.org pvoutput.org] web site.

== Donations ==

Please consider donating to PVOutput via their [http://www.pvoutput.org/donate.jsp donations page]. Bitcoin donations to the SMA2PVOutput.ps1 [#About_the_Author author] are also welcome via the address `182naT22dToTg7jQ9KM2KmKFnjfqeRna2F`.

= Getting Started =

== PVOutput.org ==

http://www.pvoutput.org is a free service for sharing, comparing and monitoring live solar photovoltaic (PV) and energy consumption data. In order to upload data to a system on PVOutput, it is first necessary to register an account.

Once you have registered a user, log in and [#Adding_a_System add your system(s)] to the account.

For more information on PVOutput, see http://www.pvoutput.org/help.html

=== API Settings ===

Your [http://www.pvoutput.org/account.jsp account settings] page on pvoutput.org includes a section titled API Settings. In order for the script to function you should ensure that the `API Access` setting within this section is set to `Enabled`.

Once `API Access` is `Enabled`, you need an [#$ApiKey API Key] which can be generated from the [http://www.pvoutput.org/account.jsp account settings] page by clicking on the `New Key` button. The [#$ApiKey API Key] is stored in the SMA2PVOutput.ps1 script as a method of authenticating with [#pvoutput.org pvoutput.org].

=== Adding a system ===

Your [http://www.pvoutput.org/account.jsp account settings] page on pvoutput.org also includes a section titled Registered Systems. Use the `Add System` link to register a new system. The [#$SystemId System Id] is also stored in the SMA2PVOutput.ps1 script as a means of identifying the system whose data is being uploaded.

== Hardware Requirements ===

=== SMA Inverter ===

The SMA2PVOutput.ps1 script uses the SMA [#Sunny_Explorer Sunny Explorer] tool to obtain data from the PV inverter. It should therefore work with any SMA inverter supported by Sunny Explorer.

A PV plant can comprise one or more inverters. The SMA2PVOutput.ps1 script is designed to work with PV plants containing up to 4 inverters.

=== Network Connectivity ===

The Windows system on which the script runs should have network connectivity to the PV Plant (typically via Bluetooth). To test this, verify that [#Sunny_Explorer Sunny Explorer] is able to connect to the plant.

The Windows system should also have access to the internet in order to post status updates to PVOutput. Ensure that any software or hardware firewalls allow access by the user running the script to pvoutput.org.
